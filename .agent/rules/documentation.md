# Documentation Maintenance Rules

- **Always update `changelog.md`**: Add an entry for every meaningful change. Group by "Added", "Fixed", or "Changed". Keep the most recent changes at the top.
- **Keep `README.md` accurate**: If you change the project architecture, state management patterns, or external API interfaces, update the README to reflect these changes.
- **Maintain AI Rules**: If global project patterns change, ensure the specific rule files in `.agent/rules/` are updated.
